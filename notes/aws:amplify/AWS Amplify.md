**GraphQL Proxy**: A component that runs the GraphQL engine for processing request and mapping them to logical functions for data operations or triggers.

**Operation**: Query, Mutation and Subscriptions

**Action**: A notification to connected subscribers, which is the result of a mutation

**Resolver**: A function that converts the GraphQL payload to the underlying storage system protocol and executes if the caller is authorized to invoke it. They are written in Velocity Template Language (VTL). [Resolver Mapping Template Reference - AWS AppSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-mapping-template-reference.html)

**Function**: A function defines a single operation that can be used across pipeline resolvers. Functions can be reused to perform redundant logic throughout the GraphQL proxy.

```bash
amplify console api
